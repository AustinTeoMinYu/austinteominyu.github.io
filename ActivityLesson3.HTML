		<p1>The children were</p1><p1 style="font-family:Forte;font-size:150%"> hungry.</p1>
		<p2>They looked out the window. Where was their mother? She</p2><br><br>
		<p3>walked into the house. The children ran over to her. “Mama, we’re so</p3><p3 style="font-family:Forte;font-size:145%"> hungry</p3><p3>," they both</p3><br><br>
		<p4>said.</p4><br><br>
		<p5>She said lunch was coming. She walked into the kitchen. She opened a can of chicken soup.</p5><br><br>
		<p6>She poured the soup into a pot. She added water. She put the pot on the stove. She made</p6><br><br>
		<p7>two peanut butter and jelly sandwiches. She sliced an apple. The soup was</p7><p7 style="font-family:Forte;font-size:145%"> hot.</p7><br><br>
		<p8>She poured it into two bowls. She put the sandwiches on two plates. She put apple slices on</p8><br><br>
		<p9>each plate. She put the bowls and plates on the table. The children ran to the table. “Thank</p9><br><br>
		<p10>you, mommy!” they said. Then they started eating. The cat and the dog watched them eat.</p10><br><br><br>
